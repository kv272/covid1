                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>a Introduction Introduction Today, computer has succeeded in making its place in every field of daily life. Computer technology has a special role in making daily progress in communication revolution. As a result of the ever increasing capabilities of computers, its usage is increasing daily in new fields. For example: our electricity and telephone bills are printed and sent by computer, seats in trains and airplanes.  Reservation is done by computer, most of the work in banks is started with the help of computer. Not only this, with the help of computer we can move from one city to another or from one country to another.

                    With the help of e-mail, they are able to send their messages in a few moments. From any corner of the world, we have been able to buy or sell our desired items through the Internet. That is, now computer is available in few places R is no longer a rare machine to use, but is becoming an object of domestic use, so the present era is being called the era of computers. Today film production, industry, trade, research, traffic control and And there is no such area of ​​space in which the need of computer is not being felt. Many such computers are being built, by which the human brain is able to execute things by understanding the computer. Nowadays computers of such small size Are being constructed, which can be carried anywhere in the pocket and can be used as per your requirement. The word 'Computer' is derived from the Latin word 'Computare', which means It means 'to calculate', but some experts believe that the word 'Computer' is derived from "Compute". Generally both literally means 'calculator'. In other words, computer is such a machine. Is, which calculates or helps us to do calculations. Input output units, central processing units and memory units are called components of a computer. Input units are the hardware that a computer Send data to The units that are used to display data and instructions as a result are called output units. A central processing unit is a part of a processing unit and computer in which econometric
                    And logical operations are performed. Memory is the part of computer in which data and instructions are stored. </p>

                    <h3>Computer</h3>
                    <p>Computer कम्प्यूटर एक स्वचालित तथा निर्देशों के अनुसार कार्य करने वाली इलेक्ट्रॉनिक डिवाइस है, जिसमें डेटा को प्राप्त, संगृहीत अथवा प्रदर्शित कर की क्षमता होती है। इस डिवाइस द्वारा प्राप्त डेटा का प्रयोग करते हुए किसी प्रोग्राम के निर्देशों के अनुसार गणितीय, तार्किक अथवा मैनिपुलेटिव क्रियाओं को सूचना के विभिन्न इच्छित रूपों में प्रदर्शित किया जा सकता है। कोई कम्प्यूटर, बड़ा हो या छोटा, नया हो या पुराना, उसकी मूल संरचना सदैव एक ही तरह की होती है। Computer' शब्द अंग्रेजी के आठ अक्षरों से मिलकर बना है, जो इसके अर्थ को और भी अधिक व्यापक बना देते हैं।
